# InOrbit Template Connector

This is a template repository for building InOrbit connectors. It contains minimal Github settings and no actual contents, which are managed by our cookiecutter package.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Run `pipx run cookiecutter gh:inorbit-ai/inorbit-connector-cookiecutter`. This will install the [cookiecutter package](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) if you don't have it already and download the InOrbit connector cookiecutter.
3. Follow the prompts to create a new connector.
4. Once all questions are answered, the cookiecutter will generate a bunch of files and directories for you to start working on your connector.
5. Read the notice at the top of the generated README.md file and follow the instructions to complete the setup.
